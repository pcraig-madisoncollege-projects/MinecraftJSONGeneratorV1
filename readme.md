# Intro PHP Programming with MySQL

This repository holds the source code written while I was taking an introductory
PHP course with MySQL.

There are three main types of content here: demos, labs, and projects. The demos
and labs were completed as in-class material, where the projects were the
larger assignments to be completed over a couple weeks.

The final project (project 4) is most notable in that it is a complete web
application with full user registration and login, and the ability for users
to save their commands to their account.

To view a full demonstration of the final project, you can watch [this presentation](https://youtu.be/nYwRjhXCZ1o)
covering various features of the project.
